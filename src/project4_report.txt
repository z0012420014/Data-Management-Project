2. Catalog information about Index
- Show your catalog information about an index (tables, columns). 

We use the format just like the table's table and column's table
Something like below

Tables (table-id:int, table-name:varchar(50), file-name:varchar(50))
Columns(table-id:int, column-name:varchar(50), column-type:int, column-length:int, column-position:int)


3. Block Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your block nested loop join works (especially, how you manage the given buffers.)

Every time I load a block of records(numPage * PAGE_SIZE) into memory. Then compare to every records in right table. After compare all right table's records, I load the next block of records to do compare.

4. Index Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works.

It just likes a for loop inside a for loop. Use one left(outer) table's record compare to all right(inner) table's record. When iterate all inner table's record, we call setIterator to reset right(inner)table to iterate again. 


5. Grace Hash Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works (especially, in-memory structure).


6. Aggregation
- Describe how your aggregation (basic, group-based hash) works.
We only do the basic aggregation.

SUM: Add all matching record's value.
MAX: Keep update the max value.
MIN: Keep update the min value.
AVG: Keep adding the value and I have a count variable. In the end, let sum divide by count.
COUNT: Keep adding the count variable.

7. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
No
- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.
No
- Other implementation details:


6. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 4, but not related to the other sections (optional)
